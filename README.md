This is the **original** version of Sneky. Any bug fixes will *not* be made, as this repository is for **preservation purposes only**.  
NOTE: I didn't have time to recreate the original snake faces, so I'll just use the faces from Sneky instead. I'll replace them with the original sprites when I have time.
